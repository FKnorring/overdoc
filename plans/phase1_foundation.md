# Phase 1: Foundation & Analysis

## 1. Project Setup with Core Dependencies

### Objectives:
- Create a modular project structure
- Set up essential dependencies for development
- Establish configuration management

### Implementation Details:
- Initialize a new Node.js/TypeScript project
- Core dependencies:
  - `fs-extra` for enhanced file system operations
  - `glob` for pattern matching in file searches
  - `simple-git` for Git operations
  - `commander` for CLI interface
  - OpenAI/LLM API client for AI analysis
  - Markdown processing tools
- Configuration system using YAML/JSON
- Directory structure for:
  - Core engine
  - AI integration
  - Documentation templates
  - Utility functions

## 2. Repository Analyzer

### Objectives:
- Develop a system to traverse code repositories
- Extract metadata about files and directories
- Build a tree representation of the project

### Implementation Details:
- Create a recursive directory traversal system
- Filters for ignoring irrelevant files (node_modules, .git, etc.)
- Metadata collection for each file:
  - File size
  - Line count
  - Last modified date
  - Import/export relationships
  - Function/class definitions
- Directory analysis:
  - File count
  - Total size
  - Structure patterns (MVC, component-based, etc.)
- Data serialization for analysis persistence

## 3. AI Model Integration

### Objectives:
- Integrate with AI models to assess entity importance
- Develop prompting strategies for entity analysis
- Create a scoring system for entity relevance

### Implementation Details:
- API integration with OpenAI/other LLM providers
- Prompt engineering for different code analysis tasks:
  - Identifying core modules
  - Detecting high-complexity areas
  - Recognizing architectural patterns
- Entity importance scoring algorithm based on:
  - Complexity metrics
  - Usage frequency 
  - Dependency relationships
  - Modification frequency (from version history)
- Caching mechanism for AI analysis results

## 4. Data Structures for Documentation Hierarchy

### Objectives:
- Design data structures to represent documentation relationships
- Create a hierarchical model of documentation nodes
- Develop serialization/deserialization for persistence

### Implementation Details:
- Graph-based data structure for entity relationships
- Node types for different documentation entities:
  - Modules/packages
  - Directories
  - Files
  - Classes/Functions
- Edge types to represent:
  - Parent-child relationships
  - Dependencies
  - Cross-references
- Serialization to JSON/YAML for persistence
- Version control awareness in the data structure
- Metadata for documentation status tracking
