## Development Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation & Analysis
1. Project setup with core dependencies in rust
2. Setup structure for traversing a repository
3. Add config for language specific file import / export structures
4. Filtering of unneccesary files and directories (build directories, files and dirs starting with ., etc..)
5. Language specific filtering, (certain config files)

### Phase 2: Export & Usage Analysis
1. Scan files to identify exported entities using language-specific patterns
2. Track references to exports by scanning imports across the repository
3. Build a graph of dependencies between files
4. Calculate usage metrics for each exported entity
5. Rank files and directories by importance based on usage count

### Phase 3: Detailed Metrics & Analysis
1. Calculate basic metrics for files (line count, file size, comment ratio)
2. Analyze code complexity metrics (function count, nesting depth, cyclomatic complexity)
3. Identify declarations and their types (classes, traits, structs, enums, interfaces)
4. Generate statistical analysis of repository (language distribution, code-to-comment ratio)
5. Visualize dependency and complexity relationships
6. Calculate "knowledge score" based on combined metrics to identify critical components

### Phase 4: Documentation & Integration
1. Generate documentation with insights from all previous phases
2. Create interactive visualizations of the repository structure
3. Integrate with existing documentation platforms and tools
4. Provide CLI and programmatic interfaces for continuous analysis
