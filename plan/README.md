## Development Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation & Analysis
1. Project setup with core dependencies
2. Repository analyzer to traverse and identify key entities
3. AI model integration for entity importance assessment
4. Data structures to represent documentation hierarchy

### Phase 2: Documentation Generation
1. Documentation template system
2. AI-powered documentation generator for entities
3. Hierarchical documentation builder (bottom-up approach)
4. Markdown generation with proper formatting

### Phase 3: Version Control Integration
1. Git hooks implementation for post-commit triggers
2. Changed files detection mechanism
3. Documentation relevance mapper (changed files â†’ affected docs)
4. Selective update system for affected documentation nodes

### Phase 4: Optimization & User Experience
1. Configuration system for customization
2. Documentation visualizer for relationship mapping
3. Performance optimization for large repositories
4. CLI interface for manual operation

### Phase 5: Testing & Deployment
1. Test suite across different repository types
2. CI/CD integration examples
3. Documentation for the tool itself
4. Package for easy installation
